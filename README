This package is a plugin to the OccupancyMapUpdater class of moveit.

It allows moveit to use an externally computed binary octomap.

It works by simply replacing the (eventual) content of the internal octree by the content of the message.
So it would not really work alongside another plugin like the PointCloudOctomapUpdater...


This plugin has been done as a quick and dirty hack so if you want to contribute, correct errors... please do.
